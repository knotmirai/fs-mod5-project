# Module 5 Final Project

# Bitcoin Price Forecasting

## The Project

Bitcoin is the longest-running and most well-known cryptocurrency, first released as open-source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin serves as a decentralized medium of digital exchange, with transactions verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger (the blockchain) without the need for a trusted record-keeping authority or central intermediary. Transaction blocks contain an SHA-256 cryptographic hash of previous transaction blocks and are thus "chained" together, serving as an immutable record of all transactions that have ever occurred. As with any currency/commodity on the market, bitcoin trading and financial instruments soon followed the public adoption of bitcoin and continue to grow. 

<b>Can we predict the price of bitcoin?</b>


## The Dataset

* Historical Bitcoin Price
* Crypto Fear and Greed Index

## Working File

* <b>student.ipynb</b>

## Result File

* presentation.pdf 

## Summary

The summary of this prediction result is:

* LSTM model can handle the data like bitcoin price better than Prophet model and give the better result.
* RSME of LSME model is 1830.08.
* The more factor we included; the better prediction result we will obtain.

## Future Plan

* Try another type of model for better results.
* Parameters tuning or optimization.
* Add another factor such as Twitter posts from influencers.
* Create our own fear and greed index.
